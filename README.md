## Using Assets

All assets are owned by me, Alasdair Mercer (neocotic), and intended for use by neocotic, however, we are an open organization so if you wish to use our assets, simply ask us for permission to do so, detailing who/what/when/where/why you intend to use them.

The best way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:alasdair@mercer.scot) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neocotic).

## Generating Assets

The assets and documentation within this repository are generated using [Brander](https://github.com/NotNinja/brander) based on our `.branderrc.json` configuration file.

To get started, first clone the repository:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/neocotic/branding.git
$ cd branding
```

Then install all of the necessary dependencies:

``` bash
branding$ npm install
```

Now you can easily generate all assets and documentation after making whatever changes you want to the configuration file or asset sources:

``` bash
branding$ npm start
```

If successful, it should end with "Done!".
