## Using Assets

All assets are owned by me, Alasdair Mercer (neocotic), and intended for use by me, however, I am open so if you wish to
use any of my assets, simply ask me for permission to do so, detailing who/what/when/where/why you intend to use them.

The best way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:mercer.alasdair@gmail.com) or on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/neocotic).

## Generating Assets

All of the assets are generated by a script using the SVG files as the source, all of which are currently coded manually
(because I'm cool like that).

Here's a simple breakdown of what the script does:

1. Reads `assets/manifest.json` file
2. Converts each SVG file (excluding `*.min.svg`) to PNG files for each size detailed in the manifest under `svg2png`
3. Converts each PNG file to ICO files for all of the recommended sizes as detailed in the manifest under `png2ico`
4. Creates an optimized version (`*.min.svg`) of all SVG files under the `assets` directory

To work with assets, you really just need to follow the existing directory structures and ensure that both the
`assets/manifest.json` and `docs/assets.md` are synchronized with the asset sources.

In order to run the script to generate the assets, you first need to checkout the code. For this, you'll need to ensure
that you have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed. Once you have that installed, you can get the code via the
following:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/neocotic/branding.git neocotic-branding
$ cd neocotic-branding
```

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6 or above installed, which will also include the
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) command-line tool that we need. Now you just need to install of the dependencies for the
script by running the following command:

``` bash
neocotic-branding$ npm install
```

Now, any time that you need to generate assets you just need to run the following:

``` bash
neocotic-branding$ npm start
```

If successful, it should end with "Done!".

If you'd like to learn more about any of the software mentioned above, you can read their online documentation:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
