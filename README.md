## Using Assets

All assets are owned by me, neocotic, and intended for use by me, however, I am pretty open so if you wish to use my assets, simply ask me for permission to do so, detailing who/what/when/where/why you intend to use them.

The best way to get in touch with me is by [raising an issue](https://github.com/neocotic/branding/issues/new).

## Generating Assets

The assets and documentation within this repository are generated using [Brander](https://github.com/neocotic/brander) based on our `.branderrc.json` configuration file.

To get started, first clone the repository:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/neocotic/branding.git
$ cd branding
```

Then install all of the necessary dependencies:

``` bash
branding$ npm install
```

Now you can easily generate all assets and documentation after making whatever changes you want to the configuration file or asset sources:

``` bash
branding$ npm start
```

If successful, it should end with "Done!".
